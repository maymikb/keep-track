Once new notes are created and saved, they appear in the left hand column of the page for clear view, and easy access. These notes will show up on the right when selected for viewing or editing, otherwise, the option to write a new note will be presented on the right side of the page while the previously written notes will be on the left.  This app makes for clear viewing as a result of organization, the notes being created have a field for a title (in bigger bold letters) before the text.
